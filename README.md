## Touchback Policy ##
If you are enrolled in the ConnectIntensive session for Fall 2016, please send me updates through Slack twice a week, by the end of day Sunday and Wednesday. Your message should include two or three items:
- 1. Which of your goals (MLND) for “today”  did you meet? If you didn’t get to some of the goals you set or didn’t complete them, please include any progress you made 
- 2. What do you expect to complete by the next touchback date? This should be specific, prioritized and realistic. It is perfectly fine to say that you don’t plan to spend any significant time on the MLND program for whatever reason. Think of it as a contract with yourself (I’m just a witness, not a judge or gatekeeper).
- 3. If you have questions or are stuck on something,tell me some of the specifics and I will try to help you resolve them. If this is your first time checking in with me please also let me know the official MLND projects you have submitted so far. If you have sent me a Slack status update previously, you can indicate a target date for your next submission.


## Requirements ##

The IPython/jupyter notebooks are tested with a Python 2.7.11+ interpreter.They also use the following packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn v0.17, v.018
- matplotlib

Additional resources from the relevant Udacity repositories are referenced in some of the notebooks and the MLND projects repository should be available on your local storage device.

Please verify that these libraries are installed in your local python environment before attempting to load and run any of the notebooks.


## Usage Terms ##

If you are enrolled in the Fall 2016 session of ConnectIntensive MLND, you may download or clone the repository for your use.

If you are not enrolled but wish to take a closer look at the  materials here, please send me an [email](emailto:lkhundkar@gmail.com) telling me who you are and your reason for requesting access to these materials. 


## Additional Resources ##

  - [Nick Hoh](https://github.com/NickyPie/ConnectIntensive)
  
#### Resources related to Udacity and ML ND ####
 - [MLND projects](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning)
 - [Deep Learning](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity) - the link to the online class is [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)

#### Other online lectures on the web ####

- General Machine Learning
    - [Nando de Freitas, Oxford University](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/) The link is to a website for a class on Machine Learning (including deep learning) taught by Nando de Freitas. There are slides, and links to YouTube videos. The videos are full-length ($ \approx $ 1 hr) and there are many of them, so not a quick introduction. If you have the time, could help cement some of the concepts you are learning in the ML ND.
    
- Deep Learning
    - [Fei-Fei-Li, Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PvXUjD6qg&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA)
    The link is to the first video lecture; there are quite  a few more. This is a class on using Deep Learning for Image Recognition (CS231n). The schedule for the course (Winter 2016. so almost a year ago) is [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)
    
- Reinforcement Learning
    - [David Silver, Oxford University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&index=1&list=PLMZdRRhAoLnKFxZlmFoFp0uHVvN2PSE9T)
 This is a set of video lectures on Reinforcement Learning by D Silver (thanks Nick!) available on Youtube that give a broader introduction to the subject. There are 10 lectures, 1.5 hrs each. If you want to learn more about RL, this may be a good place to start. There is also a website with the slides from the videos [here](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)
